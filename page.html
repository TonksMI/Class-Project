        </font> </p>
        <p>
          We compare three different types of Artificial Intelligence learning methods -
          Genetic Algorithms, the Carrot and Stick approach, and Tensorflow -
          by using each method to learn to play the simple game of Pong. We will analyze the differences
          in the effectiveness of these Artificial Intelligence methods to solve the same problem, and
          explore the implementation differences of each method.
          We will create four web sites to showcase our project and each of the different approaches to
          Machine Learning. The web sites will show the different patterns that can be observed when observing
          the progress of the AI. We will also do a formal analysis of each of the AI methods at various stages
          throughout its development of a solution. We will attempt to determine the best time to check the
          progress of each AI method to facilitate analysis. We hope to gain insight on how to learn, understand
          and solve a simple problem by observing how each AI learns a game from scratch and
          uses repeated failures to find success.

          When starting this project, we set out to build a website with multiple AIs simultaneously
          learning how to play pong, but as the semester progressed, we realized that we wouldnâ€™t be
          able to make more than one functioning AI, so we decided to focus on an AI using the carrot
          and stick approach.

        <p>
          The next steps for our project would be creating multiple AIs to compare how the different
          AIs learn pong and building the website they are hosted on into a more finalized version.
