## contributions

- Built the Pong game
- Built the Carrot and stick approach AI by implementing a fitness function that fails the AI when touching a wall and giving it a reward in points based on the distance of the ball to the paddle
    --There is a problem with the distance function that does not get values at a certain distance from the paddle for some reason
- To build upon this Pong game I would like to have more than one AI run at a time but I am unable to given time constraints
