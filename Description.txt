## Charlie Liu

I am a current student at Chapman University working towards a B.S. in Computer Science as well as a minor in Game Development Programming. I am hoping to pursue a career in the field of Computer Programming.

When I am not working and/or studying, I enjoy meeting new people, playing video games, and programming small personal projects on the side. I am passionate about technology and plan continually learning more about the workings of the cutting edge of tech such as AI, machine learning, and deep learning.
